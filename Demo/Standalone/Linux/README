This directory contains a makefile needed to run 
TonicAudio standalone test under Linux.

Tested on Ubuntu 12.04.

NOTE: 64-bit systems require packages:
- g++-multilib

## RTAUDIO

The demo uses RTAudio for real-time audio hardware abstraction, which supports several different Linux audio APIs. 
The makefile builds against ALSA by default, so please edit the makefile to use a different API if you are not using ALSA.

The following Linux audio APIs are supported:

ALSA
Requred Packages:
- libasound

OSS (untested)
Required Packages:
- n/a

PulseAudio (untested)
Required Packages:
- libpulse-simple
- libpulse

JACK (untested)

Note: RtAudio works fine for ordinary sound cards, but
seems to have occasional compatibity problems with high-end GPUs.
